# Horiseon Website Refactor 

# Description: 
Horiseon is a company that specializes in improving websites through marketing practices.  This company works on search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.  

My task was to refactor this website.  I was able to add alt tags to images, a title, and semantic elements.  I also renamed some CSS classes and removed duplicate code.  I added comments to the style sheet and html sheet.
